# Become a Contributor

Thank you for considering contributing to Daytistics! We are happy to welcome you to our community. We are a small team of developers and designers who are passionate about creating a tool that helps people to reflect on their day and to improve their productivity. We are always looking for new contributors who can help us to improve Daytistics.

## üèóÔ∏è Creating Issues

One very simple way to contribute to Daytistics, whether you're a developer or not, is to create issues. If you find a bug or have a feature request you can create an issue on our [Issue Tracker](). Please make sure to follow the template when creating an issue. This will help us to understand your problem or feature request better.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Contribute

If you decide to contribute with code, please follow these steps:

1. Pick an issue from the [Issue Tracker]() that you want to work on. Please make sure that the issue is not already assigned to someone else and that it is marked as `state: approved`. 
2. Fork the repository and create a new branch with the name `issue-<issue-number>`. For example, if you want to work on issue #42, you should create a branch called `issue-42`.
3. Implement your changes and make sure that the code is well tested and documented using docstrings.
4. Create a pull request to the `main` branch of the repository. Please make sure to follow the pull request template.
5. Wait for the review of your pull request. We will give you feedback on your changes and help you to improve your code if necessary.
6. After the review, we will merge your pull request into the `main` branch.
7. üéâ Congratulations! You have successfully contributed to Daytistics.


## üëæ How to Get to Know the Code Base

We don't have a real code documentation, because we believe that the best documentation is the code itself. However, we do also force contributors to write docstrings for their code. Therefore, you can find a lot of information about the code in the docstrings. If you have any questions about the code, you can always ask in our [discord](http://discord.daytistics.com/) or write an email to <contact@daytistics.com>.
