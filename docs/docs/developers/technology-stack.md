# Technology Stack

## 🎨 Frontend

Our frontend is built with [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) and [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com). We use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and it's plugin [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) for styling. For the visualization of the data, we use [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/). Our JavaScript runtime is [Bun](https://bun.sh/).

## 💻 Backend

Our backend is built in [Python](https://www.python.org/) with the [Django framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/). To provide a powerful REST API we use [Django Ninja](https://django-ninja.dev/). While developing we use [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) as our database. In production, we use [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). Our suggestions are based on a fine-tuned [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) [Claude](https://claude.ai) model. Our Python packages are managed by Poetry.

## 📄 Documentation

Our documentation is written in Markdown and hosted on GitHub Pages. We use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate the documentation. 

## 🚀 Deployment

Our deployment process is managed by GitHub Actions. We use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to containerize our application. 

## 🖨️ Infrastructure

Our services, databases, webspace and domain are hosted on [AitchSystems](https://aitch.systems). We use a self-hosted [Coolify](https://coolify.io) instance as an easy-to-use and cheap PaaS.
