# Welcome to Daytistics

Daytistics is a web application written primarily in Python where you can enter how you spent your day. Daytistics visualizes this data and based on it gives you useful tips to increase your productivity. Additionally, we offer a self-hosted AI to predict your well-being on a hypothetical day.

> Daytistics is currently under heavy development. Therefore, use is only possible via self-hosting. However, this is not recommended.
