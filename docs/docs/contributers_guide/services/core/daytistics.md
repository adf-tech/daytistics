# Daytistics

## Templates

If you take a look at the template structure of the Daytistics app, you will find a very confusing combination of Django template functionality, Java Script fetch requests and HTML. This is confusing and not exactly best practice, but this is because HTML does not really work well in combination with the opened modals. Therefore, the relationships and functions for creating and editing Daytistics are explained here.
