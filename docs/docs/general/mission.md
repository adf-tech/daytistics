### Our Mission

> **“Empowerment through Self-Reflection and Transparency”**

Daytistics enables individuals to gain deeper insights into their lives by tracking activities and well-being. We help users identify patterns that lead to better decisions. Our open-source platform ensures transparency and gives users full control over their data, whether self-hosted or through our Pay-As-You-Go service.
