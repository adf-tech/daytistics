# Features

This document covers all our relevant features in depth.

> Due to our early development status, not all features are listed on this page, and the exact feature specifications are subject to change.

## Daytistics

Our application is all about Daytistics. A Daytistic is a daily (it depends on you :D) entry that consists of a list of activities you did that day, your well-being that day and a connection to a diary entry.

## Visualization

You can visualize relationships between the activities performed and your well-being. We support timelines, pie charts and bar charts.

## AI-Integration

We offer you two AI models trained especially for you: the Predictor and the Suggestor.

The Predictor receives data from you about a hypothetical day and tells you how your well-being would be on that day. This way you are spared unwanted unproductive days (of course you can be unproductive sometimes).

The Suggestor works with ChatGPT and gives tips for improvement based on the past.

## Activities

Of course we offer ready-made activities. However, you also have the option of creating your own activities.

## Diary

You have the option to create small 5-minute diary entries, which consist of a short entry and a moment of happiness.
